; TWOCELLS is the number of frames in a dot and the space after it.
; Because a standard word is 50 cells (25*TWOCELLS), and the NTSC NES
; runs 60.1 fps, the words per minute value is 144.24/TWOCELLS.
TWOCELLS = 7

; Morse letters with 0=dot, 1=dash, and 1000...=terminate

; Several emulators don't load the last bank at power-on for AOROM,
; BNROM, GNROM, and UNROM Crazy.  Instead they load the first bank.
; Work around these by putting a special reset stub at $B000 in
; the first bank.  ($8000-$BFFF is in both the first and last banks.)
; May need more testing to determine whether the stub needs to be
; placed in all 16K banks.
